# Domain Watchdog

Domain Watchdog is a standalone application that utilizes RDAP to gather publicly accessible information about domain
names, track their history, and automatically purchase them. For more information please check [the wiki](https://github.com/maelgangloff/domain-watchdog/wiki) !

## Why use it?

- **Historical Tracking**: Know the history of a domain name, from its inception to its release into the public domain.
- **Detailed Monitoring**: Follow the evolution of a domain name and the entities that manage it in detail.
- **Auto-purchase Domain**: You want the domain name of your dreams, but it is already taken? Domain Watchdog detects
  the deletion of the domain name on WHOIS and can trigger the purchase of the domain name via a provider's API

Although the RDAP and WHOIS protocols allow you to obtain precise information about a domain, it is not possible to
perform a reverse search to discover a list of domain names associated with an entity. Additionally, accessing a
detailed history of events (ownership changes, renewals, etc.) is not feasible with these protocols.

## Install

> [!TIP]
> For more details on the installation procedure, please refer to [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md).

### Docker Deployment

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Docker image locally
    ```shell
    docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml build --pull --no-cache
    ```
3. Modify environment variables and add static files to customize your instance
4. Start the project in production environment
    ```shell
    docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up
    ```

## How it works?

### RDAP search

The latest version of the WHOIS protocol was standardized in 2004 by RFC 3912.[^1] This protocol allows anyone to
retrieve key information concerning a domain name, an IP address, or an entity registered with a registry.

ICANN launched a global vote in 2023 to propose replacing the WHOIS protocol with RDAP. As a result, registries and
registrars will no longer be required to support WHOIS from 2025 (*WHOIS Sunset Date*).[^2]

Domain Watchdog uses the RDAP protocol, which will soon be the new standard for retrieving information concerning domain
names. The data is organized in a SQL database to minimize space by ensuring an entity is not repeated.

### Connector Provider

A connector is a way to order a domain name. It is important to mention that this project does not act as a payment
intermediary.
Indeed, the user's credentials are directly used to enable the purchase via the provider's API. To this end, the user
gives his consent to define the legal framework in which the use of his account with the provider's API will be made.

The table below lists the supported API connector providers:

| Provider  | Documentation                                                 | Supported |
|:---------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|:---------:|
|    OVH    | https://api.ovh.com                                           |  **Yes**  |
|   GANDI   | https://api.gandi.net/docs/domains/                           |  **Yes**  |
| NAMECHEAP | https://www.namecheap.com/support/api/methods/domains/create/ |           |

### Watchlist

A watchlist is a list of domain names, triggers and possibly an API connector.
They allow you to follow the life of the listed domain names and send you a notification when a change has been
detected.

If a domain has expired and a connector is linked to the Watchlist, then Domain Watchdog will try to order it via the
connector provider's API.

Note: If the same domain name is present on several Watchlists, on the same principle as the raise condition, it is not
possible to predict in advance which user will win the domain name. The choice is left to chance.
